            <h3>The Podcast</h3>
            FLOSS for science is a podcast with the goal of showcasing free, libre and open source software uses in science. We want to highlight how FLOSS empowers researchers and enables them to produce high quality research. Through each of our episodes, we want to showcase a scientist using FLOSS to produce his/her research or the developers of software used for scientific research. In this audio show, we want to present real uses cases applicable for scientists. When we will interview software developers we will focus on the motivation to start the project, their interaction with the community and the reasons to release their software as FLOSS instead of focussing on the implementation details of the software. Although both presenters comes from an engineering background, FLOSS for science is open to anyone from any branch of science. </p>

            At FLOSS for science, we want to produce high quality audio content published under the licence CC-BY-ND 4.0. </p>
