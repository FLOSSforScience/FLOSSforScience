#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  For episode 15, we interview the Associate Professor of Archaeology Ben Marwick. We start our discussion with an overview of some FLOSS tools he uses and how much FLOSS are used in  archaeology. He shares with us his experience in regard to working completely in the open with GitHub and his hope that open science will become the norm in the future. We also discuss about rrtools  and his propositions on how to greatly improve the reproducibility of science. As a closing though he shares with us his arguments why early career researchers should invest time to learn and transition to FLOSS tools.

# Outline

For episode 17, we interviewd Adrian Serio the Scientific Program Coordinator of the [Ste||ar group](http://stellar-group.org/) about the C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism (HPX).

# About Adrian Serio:

Adrian Serio is the Scientific Program Coordinator for the STE||AR group at Louisiana State University. In this role, he assists in the development of HPX, a distributed C++ runtime system for parallelism and concurrency. Adrian was surprised to find himself working in HPC after graduating with a bachelor degree in biological engineering in 2011. Nevertheless, he loves working in a university setting where he gets exposed to cutting edge research and work with an international team of collaborators.
