podcast_description: |
  In episode 17, we interviewed Adrian Serio the Scientific Program Coordinator of the STELLAR group about the C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism (HPX). We started with a general discussion about parallel computing, where it comes from, where it is going and what can we still expect to gain. We then clarified what are C++ standards and how HPX is developed to be standard compliant. HPX was compared to other parallelism libraries such as MPI and we learned that HPX is a foundation to develop other software for domain specific applications. Adrian informed us how HPX can be used to take advantage of hardware accelerators such as Intel Xeon Phi or GPUs. We looked at the inception of the project and the sources of contributions to the project

# Outline

In episode 17, we interviewed Adrian Serio the Scientific Program Coordinator of the [Ste||ar group](http://stellar-group.org/) about the C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism (HPX). We started with a general discussion about parallel computing, where it comes from, where it is going and what can we still expect to gain. We then clarified what are C++ standards and how HPX is developed to be standard compliant. HPX was compared to other parallelism libraries such as MPI and we learned that HPX is a foundation to develop other software for domain specific applications. Adrian informed us how HPX can be used to take advantage of hardware accelerators such as Intel Xeon Phi or GPUs. We looked at the inception of the project and the sources of contributions to the project

# About Adrian Serio:

Adrian Serio is the Scientific Program Coordinator for the STE||AR group at Louisiana State University. In this role, he assists in the development of HPX, a distributed C++ runtime system for parallelism and concurrency. Adrian was surprised to find himself working in HPC after graduating with a bachelor degree in biological engineering in 2011. Nevertheless, he loves working in a university setting where he gets exposed to cutting edge research and work with an international team of collaborators.
