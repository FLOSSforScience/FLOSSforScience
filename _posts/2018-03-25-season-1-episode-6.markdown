In Episode 6, we interviewed  Christian Horea about the [NeuroGentoo Overlay](https://github.com/TheChymera/neurogentoo) for Gentoo Linux which includes specific packages for Neuroscience. With this distribution many of the challenges in neuroscience software management; including: system replicability, system documentation, data analysis reproducibility, fine-grained dependency management, easy control over compilation options, and seamless access to cutting-edge software releases, are addresed. Fore more details we refer to his publication: [Gentoo Linux for Neuroscience - a replicable, flexible, scalable, rolling-release environment that provides direct access to development software](https://riojournal.com/article/12095/). 




About Christian Horea: 

Neuroscientist by day, neuroscientist by night. Coding happens
concurrently, sleep sporadically. I don't know when I first noticed
that the mind is notoriously hard to control and predict - but I've
wanted to control and predict it ever since. The journey has been
winding and it has always involved drugs and neuroimaging. I became a
coder without ever wanting or realizing it, and could never imagine not
being one. To help me comprehend the uncomprehended, I decided to use
the computer as an extension of my mind, and as such it needs to
execute on thoughts which are just as transparent, shareable, and
reproducible as all the rest of them. I call these thoughts Free and
Open Source Scientific Software. In fact, with my ongoing work on
software management, these may just end up becoming some of my
clearest, most easily shared, and best documented thoughts.
