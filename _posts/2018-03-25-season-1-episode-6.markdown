In Episode 6, we interviewed  Christian Horea ([@TheChymera](https://twitter.com/TheChymera), [(ResearchGate Profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Horea_Christian)) about the [NeuroGentoo Overlay](https://github.com/TheChymera/neurogentoo) for Gentoo Linux which includes specific packages for Neuroscience. With this distribution many of the challenges in neuroscience software management; including: system replicability, system documentation, data analysis reproducibility, fine-grained dependency management, easy control over compilation options, and seamless access to cutting-edge software releases, are addresed. Fore more details we refer to his publication: [Gentoo Linux for Neuroscience - a replicable, flexible, scalable, rolling-release environment that provides direct access to development software](https://riojournal.com/article/12095/).
