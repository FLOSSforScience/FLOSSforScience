#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  In Episode 10, we interviewed Sébastien Loriot about CGAL. A software project that provides easy access to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation, such as geographic information systems, computer aided design, molecular biology, medical imaging, computer graphics, and robotics.

  The library offers data structures and algorithms like triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra, point set processing, arrangements of curves, surface and volume mesh generation, geometry processing, alpha shapes, convex hull algorithms, shape analysis, AABB and KD trees...

# Outline

In Episode 10, we interviewed Sébastien Loriot about [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/). A software project that provides easy access to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation, such as geographic information systems, computer aided design, molecular biology, medical imaging, computer graphics, and robotics.

The library offers data structures and algorithms like triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra, point set processing, arrangements of curves, surface and volume mesh generation, geometry processing, alpha shapes, convex hull algorithms, shape analysis, AABB and KD trees...

# About Sébastien Loriot: 

Sébastien is co-author of several CGAL packages and is also part of the editorial board of the library. He is mainly working on various operations on polyhedral surfaces within [GeometryFactory](https://geometryfactory.com/).
