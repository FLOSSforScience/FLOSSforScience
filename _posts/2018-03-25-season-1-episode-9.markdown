# About Bruno Blais: 

Bruno Blais is a Research Officer with the Automotive and Surface Transportation Portfolio of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC AST) and an associate Professor at the department of Chemical Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal. He has earned a B. Eng. in Chemical Engineering, a Grande École Engineering Diploma from ENSTA Paristech, a master in Fundamental Fluid Mechanics from ENSTA and a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Polytechnique Montreal. Bruno is a Vanier Graduate Scholar (2012-2016) and has received the Govenor’s General gold academic medal for his thesis work on numerical modeling of multiphase flow. He has also received the best thesis award from Ecole Polytechnique (2017) and the North American Mixing Forum (2016-2017). Bruno has also received other recognitions such as the Da Vinci Profile of Ecole Polytechnique (2012) and the Master Île-De-France international Scholarship (2011-2012). Bruno’s expertise lies in the development, verification, and validation of high performance digital models for fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and complex multi-physical and multi-scale phenomena. His research interests are in computational fluid mechanics (CFD), reacting flow, granular and solid-fluid flow modeling, topology optimization as well as high-performance computing on distributed high-performance architecture and on GPU. He has been an active collaborator of the [CFDEM project](www.cfdem.com), an open source platform for granular and solid-fluid flows, since 2013.
