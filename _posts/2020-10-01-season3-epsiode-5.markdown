#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  Note : This interview was recorded in the summer of 2020. However, due to the pandemic we could not release the episode timely. Therefore, the current status of FSF and recent events are not discussed in this episode.
  
  In episode 31, we interviewed Craig Topham from the Licensing and Compliance Team of the GNU Project about GNU software licenses. We started by discussing about his involvment in the compliance team at the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and what got him interested in the topic of free software. The portion of the interview centered around the GNU project with an emphasis on the GNU software licenses. We went through the GPL, LGPL, AGPL and GFDL licenses to explain some of their differences and why you may want to use one instead of another. We asked questions about the specificities of licensing your code in the context of scientific software and the issue with licenses proliferation. Some of the differences between the different versions of the GPL were presented later in the discussion to show the improvements brought in the version 3 in regard to the compliance and patent sections. We asked him about his take on the philosophical differences between GNU style licenses and the MIT/BSD licenses in regard to the debate between user and developper freedom. We followed by going through some myths surrounding the GNU licenses and a general discussion about freedom and privacy. We finished the interview with our usual quick questions.

# Outline

Note : This interview was recorded in the summer of 2020. However, due to the pandemic we could not release the episode timely. Therefore, the current status of FSF and recent events are not discussed in this episode.

In episode 31, we interviewed Craig Topham from the Licensing and Compliance Team of the GNU Project about GNU software licenses. We started by discussing about his involvment in the compliance team at the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and what got him interested in the topic of free software. The portion of the interview centered around the GNU project with an emphasis on the GNU software licenses. We went through the GPL, LGPL, AGPL and GFDL licenses to explain some of their differences and why you may want to use one instead of another. We asked questions about the specificities of licensing your code in the context of scientific software and the issue with licenses proliferation. Some of the differences between the different versions of the GPL were presented later in the discussion to show the improvements brought in the version 3 in regard to the compliance and patent sections. We asked him about his take on the philosophical differences between GNU style licenses and the MIT/BSD licenses in regard to the debate between user and developper freedom. We followed by going through some myths surrounding the GNU licenses and a general discussion about freedom and privacy. We finished the interview with our usual quick questions.

# Clarifications

Craig asked us to post some clarifications after he listend to the recording:

* 7:55, I utterly failed to mention an exclusive member benefit, our membership card which is a bootable USB Drive! <https://www.fsf.org/associate/card> I think I was distracted when I heard "credit card", weird.
* 8:11, Libreplanet was held virtually in both [2020](https://libreplanet.org/2021/) and [2021](https://libreplanet.org/2021/)! Not the best joke, but I got a laugh! 
* 22:29, I said "other programs" interacting with LGPL software, when I should have said "other code compiled together" with LGPL source code.
* 23:21, I messed up "Service as a Software Substitute" (SAASS), useful [article](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html).
* 30:51, I said GPL instead of GPLv3
* 36:56, I could have avoided saying, "that should be enough to cover it", but instead emphasized useful programs like the [FSFE's REUSE](https://reuse.software/).
* 37:39, I should not have said, "as far as legality goes" around the COPYING and README files in the source code. A more appropriate replacement would be, "as far as what is required by the GPL and other common practices".
* 37:54, I misspoke. I meant to say that an author should register their work (source code) with the Copyright Office in order to defend ownership in court. They would not register it "as licensed under the GPL", only that they are the author of the work.
