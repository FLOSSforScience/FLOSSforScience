#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  For episode 13, we interviewed Martin Owens, a British Free Software contractor based in Boston Massachusetts, during the 2018 Kiel Inkscape Hackfest, about the Inkscape project. After a brief presentation of Inkscape, we talked about the svg file format and the compatibility of Inkscape with other commercial proprietary offerings. He presented us a list of features planned for Inkscape 1.0, the next major version. We discussed about Inkscape in science and the wider importance of free software and open science. Follow us to be informed when we will release our next episode about the GNU image manipulation program aka GIMP.

# Outline

  

# About Scientific Linux:

Scientific Linux is a Linux distribution intended to provide a platform 
for scientific computing and specifically for high-energy physics 
computing.  Because experiments in our field can run for years or even 
decades, we need a stable operating system that allows for security 
patching and major bug fixes, but otherwise remains stable, so that 
physics results do not have to be re-validated frequently.  The first 
version, Scientific Linux 3, was based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 
was released in 2004 in conjunction with CERN.  Scientific Linux has been 
widely adopted by physics labs like Fermilab, by many university 
departments, and by others in the community.

# About Glenn Cooper: 

I started as an astronomer and taught physics and astronomy at several 
colleges and universities.  I moved into computing, winding up at 
Fermilab, "America's particle physics and accelerator laboratory". I lead 
a department here that manages most of the computers used by experiments 
at Fermilab, as well as many used by the CMS experiment at the CERN 
laboratory in Europe.  Besides managing computers and their operating 
systems, we also manage batch computing software on many of the computers. 
Finally, we build, distribute, and support Scientific Linux.
