#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  In episode 17, we interviewed Adrian Serio the Scientific Program Coordinator of the STELLAR group about the C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism (HPX). We started with a general discussion about parallel computing, where it comes from, where it is going and what can we still expect to gain. We then clarified what are C++ standards and how HPX is developed to be standard compliant. HPX was compared to other parallelism libraries such as MPI and we learned that HPX is a foundation to develop other software for domain specific applications. Adrian informed us how HPX can be used to take advantage of hardware accelerators such as Intel Xeon Phi or GPUs. We looked at the inception of the project and the sources of contributions to the project

# Outline

In episode 17, we interviewed Adrian Serio the Scientific Program Coordinator of the [STELLAR group](http://stellar-group.org/) about the C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism (HPX). We started with a general discussion about parallel computing, where it comes from, where it is going and what can we still expect to gain. We then clarified what are C++ standards and how HPX is developed to be standard compliant. HPX was compared to other parallelism libraries such as MPI and we learned that HPX is a foundation to develop other software for domain specific applications. Adrian informed us how HPX can be used to take advantage of hardware accelerators such as Intel Xeon Phi or GPUs.

# About Arfon Smith:

Arfon Smith is the Head of the Data Science Mission Office at Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. Previously he was at GitHub, helping to bring open source to academia.

A lapsed academic with a passion for new models of scientific collaboration, he's used big telescopes to study dust in space, built sequencing pipelines in Cambridge and has engaged millions of people in online citizen science by co-founding the Zooniverse.

He’s also been known to publish the odd paper and has also accidentally built a few academic journals in his time too including, most recently, the Journal of Open Source Software.

# About the C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism (HPX):

The Journal of Open Source Software is an open source, developer-friendly journal for research software packages. It’s designed to make it as easy as possible to create a software paper for your work. If a piece of software is already well documented, then paper preparation (and submission) should take no more than an hour. The primary purpose of a JOSS paper is to enable citation credit to be given to authors of research software and we have a rigorous peer review process and a first-class editorial board (http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) highly experienced at building (and reviewing) high-quality research software.
