In Episode 7, we interviewed Karl Fogel and James Vasile about Chaper 9: Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents of Karl's book: Producing Open Source Software - How to Run a Successful Free Software Project. Chossing a license for ones open source project is essentiell and we discussed why one should ship their scientific open source code with an license. In addittion, we talked about the implications of providing an license. Another apsect was open source license compatibilty for the integration of libraries to an existing project.

In this epsiode we focused on a general overview about licenses, implications of choosing a license, and the legal aspects of licenses.
