#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  For Episode 7, we interviewed Karl Fogel and James Vasile about the importance of software licenses for scientists. The discussion was inspired from Chapter 9: Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents of Karl's book: Producing Open Source Software - How to Run a Successful Free Software Project. Choosing a license for ones open source project is essential and we discussed why one should ship their scientific open source code with a license. In addition, we talked about the implications of providing a license and the legal aspects of licenses. Another aspect was open source license compatibility for the integration of libraries to an existing project. We also had a discussion in regards to the expectations of academic developers.

# Outline

For Episode 7, we interviewed Karl Fogel and James Vasile about the importance of software licenses for scientists. The discussion was inspired from Chapter 9: Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents of Karl's book: Producing Open Source Software - How to Run a Successful Free Software Project. Choosing a license for ones open source project is essential and we discussed why one should ship their scientific open source code with a license. In addition, we talked about the implications of providing a license and the legal aspects of licenses. Another aspect was open source license compatibility for the integration of libraries to an existing project. We also had a discussion in regards to the expectations of academic developers.
