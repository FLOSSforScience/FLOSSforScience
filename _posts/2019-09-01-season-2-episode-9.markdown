#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  In episode 20, we interviewed Arfon Smith, Editor-in-chief of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) and Head of Data Science at the Space Telescope Science Institute. We talked with him about the creation of JOSS and its role in peer reviewed publications of research software. He described to us how to start a peer reviewed scientific journal and the challenges and competition that he faces. We chatted about how, by using automation, reusing existing tools and staying nimble, JOSS manages to publish with low operational costs. We also discussed about the submission process and what is reviewed during the peer review. Finally, we had a discussion about the importance of FLOSS and  in science and how science and FLOSS could inspire each other.

# About Juan Pablo Carbajal:

Juan Pablo is a physicist from Argentina, currently living in Switzerland. He has been using GNU Octave for more than 15 years. GNU Octave is one of the FLOSS tools he uses for research and development (applied complex systems). He is also a promoter of education and training using FLOSS. He provides GNU Octave technical training at CERN, and in his small non-profit, which also promotes programming and robotics among teenagers using FLOSS. In his free time he contributes to GNU Octave, maintains a few small packages, and provides help in the mailing list. You can know more about Juan Pablo on his [website](https://sites.google.com/site/juanpicarbajal).

# About GNU Octave:

GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave’s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
