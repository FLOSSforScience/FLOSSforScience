#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  For episode 8, we interviewed Bruno Blais about his utilization of open source software in his research about solid-liquid mixing. We started our conversation by talking about the different kinds of software packages he uses in his simulation workflow. We then asked him why and when he has decided to use FLOSS tools in is research. Following that, we talked about his philosophical and practical reasons to use FLOSS. He then shared with us how he contributes to the software he is using in his daily research. Finally, we talked with him about the significance of FLOSS for the openness of science and how it affects the society as a whole. This episode is the first of series about computer simulations. Follow us to be informed when we will release our next episode about the open source meshing tool GMSH.

# About Gimp:

The GNU Image Manipulation Program, GIMP, has been a fixture of the Free Software world since 1995. It has long been a standard cross-platform tool available to FL/OSS users for manipulating graphics and images, and is also the namesake of the GTK project (the GIMP Toolkit). For over twenty years GIMP has been available to help users create and modify all manner of graphics for scientific computing, photography, and digital arts.

# About Pat David: 

Pat David is a Free Software advocate, occasional photographer, and digital dabbler.  He has been a member of the GIMP team for many years now, and did the recent re-design of the GIMP website.  He is also the founder of the Free Software photography community [PIXLS.US](https://pixls.us/). His time is usually spent annoying, then helping, various FL/OSS projects (in that order).
