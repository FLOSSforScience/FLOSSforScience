#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  For episode 8, we interviewed Bruno Blais about his utilization of open source software in his research about solid-liquid mixing. We started our conversation by talking about the different kinds of software packages he uses in his simulation workflow. We then asked him why and when he has decided to use FLOSS tools in is research. Following that, we talked about his philosophical and practical reasons to use FLOSS. He then shared with us how he contributes to the software he is using in his daily research. Finally, we talked with him about the significance of FLOSS for the openness of science and how it affects the society as a whole. This episode is the first of series about computer simulations. Follow us to be informed when we will release our next episode about the open source meshing tool GMSH.

# About Ben Marwick: 

Ben Marwick is an Associate Professor of Archaeology at the University of Washington, Seattle. His other local affiliations include the eScience Institute, the Burke Museum, the Center for Statistics and Social Sciences, the Quaternary Research Center, and the Southeast Asia Center. Ben's main research activities combine models from evolutionary ecology with analyses of archaeological evidence to investigate past human behaviour. Specific interests include the hominin colonisation of mainland Southeast Asia, forager technologies and ecology in Australia, mainland Southeast Asia and elsewhere. He also analyses how archaeology engages with local communities and popular culture. Ben has a special interest in techniques and methods for reproducible research, especially using open source software. To support this, he has lead the development of the rrtools package for the R programming language, which simplifies many of the tasks of writing a reproducible manuscript.
