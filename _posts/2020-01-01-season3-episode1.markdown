#Description of the podcast
podcast_description: |
  In episode 24, we interviewed Simon Hettrick Professor at the University of Southampton in the UK. We started the discussion with him by asking about his transition from deveoppin high-power lasers to founding the research software engineers (RSE) association and how his experiences got him in his current position. We then discussed about the roles of RSE in research and how funding for RSE evolved over the past. The discussion went on about the RSE association, its growth over time, branches in other countries and local events. We discussed that the relation between FLOSS and more sustainable research software is not always clear and more work is needed in that area. After talking with him about the lack of sufficient preparation that students receives during their undergrad studies in regard to the tools needed to tackle research software development we finished with our usual quick questions.

# Outline


# About FreeCAD:

FreeCAD is a cross-platform parametric 3D modeler. Architecturally, it is a Qt application with a C++ core extended with Python, and uses a modular, workbench-based approach. Besides traditional CAD functionality, FreeCAD offers computer-aided engineering and manufacturing features, integrating with other open source projects like OpenFOAM (CFD), Gmsh & Netgen (meshers), CalculiX & Elmer (FEA solvers), IFCOpenShell (BIM), OpenCAMLib (CAM/CNC) as well as integration with KiCAD for electronics design automation.

# About Kurt Kremitzki:

Kurt Kremitzki is a biosystems engineer, an admin/developer for the FreeCAD project, and a Debian Maintainer on the Science Team. During the day, he works as a Scientific Software Developer for Enthought, a digital transformation company at the heart of the scientific Python ecosystem.
